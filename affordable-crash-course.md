# The PSCG Embedded Linux Crash course / Intense training

## About
 You will get everything you need to explore all the concepts of Embedded Linux in class with Ron Munitz, and then you will work very hard at home, ask questions, solve interesting exercises, and port important concepts into an open suorced powerful research oriented build system.

By the end of the training you will have the working knowledge to feel comfortable with taking on Embedded Linux porting and research oriented jobs.

## Methodology and alternative courses (This course is different)
The course is different. It is designed to be cheap, by trading the instructor time in class, with your self research and determination time at home. You will get all the tools to have the best training experience in your own time - what you do with it is up to you.

The course is accompanied with hundreds of hours of complimentary video recordings.

If you are intereted in 1 week or longer training and are your company or you are willing to pay the full PSCG or Linux Foundation price ranges for such, you may contact training@thepscg.com for a more standard training.
The most popular course at the time of writing would be the [Embedded Linux Course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ew7UPhdHNpEcX5mXNQaKbJKpmSPEndeSN-Pk7frXsts). You should expect the same contents (but not the exact same materials!), for a fraction of the price.
